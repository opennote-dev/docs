We're looking for a talented and motivated developer to work on internal development and remote computation research for the `tuna` platform.&#x20;

Tuna is an open-source Python CLI tool that interacts with a Python backend meant to run independently of OS and machine hardware.&#x20;

The backend interacts heavily with various APIs, and we use various developer services, such as FluidStack, AWS, GCP, AKASH, DigitalOcean, and Intel Developer Cloud to run tests for all toolings.

We also are working on a Web Console built in Next.js and use a variety of Bash scripts, Docker images, and more, all to run Linux machines with some of the most powerful GPUs on the market, and we're rapidly expanding our stack.

If you tune your workflow for maximum efficiency, test developer tools, or generally enjoy system engineering, you're a perfect fit for this role!

* Develop scripts to automate remote connections, run watchfiles threads, and automate processes for developers to have amazing experiences.&#x20;
* Enjoy building expertise around the infrastructure and platforms.&#x20;
* Are intensely motivated, and ready to take on difficult engineering challenges, and write secure, clean, and efficient software, focusing on amazing user experiences.&#x20;

**Here's what we've currently done:**&#x20;

* Integration with GPU rental services for automated port-forwarding of machines to the local computer.&#x20;
* Autogenerating massive Jupyter Notebooks and Datasets entirely in a locally efficient script.&#x20;
* Preserving states, configurations, and more across many remote instances.&#x20;
* The ability for a user to deploy their automated fine-tuned LLMs to HuggingFace and other Developer Clouds
* Detailed documentation, development, and more for a very streamlined UX.&#x20;
* Fine-tuned a variety of Foundational Models on a variety of Datasets, both for development and for our parent site, [https://opennote.me](https://opennote.me) (check it out!)
