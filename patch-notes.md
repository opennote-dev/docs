### Major Changes

* Redesigned entire application UI from the ground up, redefining the design language of the site, including the landing pages, the dashboard, profile management, and more, while keeping the feel and _vibes_ the same. UX has been much more in the forefront of our minds.&#x20;
  * Additionally, the site is now _mostly_ responsive to mobile. If you find issues, report a bug (which you can do once you've logged in and are on the spaces page)&#x20;
* **Opennote Premium** is out! For those that are willing to support just that extra little bit, get access to insane benefits for the small small price of $5 a month. Additionally, sneak preview features, and chat with developers with all the perks :)
* Multiple models? Oh my!&#x20;
  * Opennote Premium now allows users to choose Animator 2.0 and Tutor 2.0, our most advanced fleet yet of AI models ready to serve your educational needs.&#x20;
  * Not quite ready for Premium? No worries. Animator 1.0 and Tutor 1.0 have been redesigned from the ground up too! More context windows, better videos, better learning.&#x20;
* Implemented a brand new Markdown Engine, that makes sure your chats are easy to read and understand. View Latex, Codeblocks, and every single major markdown feature (_up to heading level 6!_) from the comfort of the new chatbot UI.&#x20;
* Implemented GitHub, Obsidian, Notion, PDF, Image, and Code document parsing and generation. Use our brand new fleet of integrations to optimize Opennote to your preferred workflow. No third-parties or even copy-pasting required.

#### Minor Quality of Life and Development Changes

* Databases have been redone! Everything is optimized and good to go for users, subscriptions, spaces, files, and more.&#x20;
* Videos are now optimized for bitrate quality.
* The `https://open-note.tech` domain has been deprecated, and is left only for the Devpost

### Features Coming _very very_ Soon&#x20;

* Google Drive Integration&#x20;
* Robust OAuth support, mitigating bugs with repeated authentication
* The most advanced suite of Opennote models yet (we still had to make our datasets, and get everything set up, but now, itll all be worth it)
  * Better audio, _much_ more aware video, and a variety of other things soon :)

We have so much more to show you over the coming months, and we are _so_ excited that you've joined us on this journey.&#x20;
